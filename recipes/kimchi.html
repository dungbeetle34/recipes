    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Kimchi is such a simple healthy food and you won't regret learning to make this delicious side dish</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div>
        Napa Cabbage<br>
        Non-Iodized Salt<br>
        Korean Pepper Flakes<br>
        Garlic<br>
        Ginger<br>
        Sugar<br>
        Carrot or Daikon Radish<br>
        Green Onions<br>
    </div>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><em><strong>Sterilize everything</strong></em><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wash your hands well before every time you touch the ingredients. Wash supplies with hot water. Clean is key with any fermentation!</li>
        <li><em><strong>Brine the cabbage</strong></em><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rinse the cabbage well, then cut it into quarters, lengthwise. Place in a large bowl and cover completely with salt, working the salt in between all the leaves. Let sit for about 2 hours, massaging and turning the cabbage every 30 minutes, until cabbage has wilted down. When finished, drain and rinse the cabbage very well (until a torn-off piece no longer tastes overly salty). Squeeze out the excess water.</li>
        <li><em><strong>Flavor it up</strong></em><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While cabbage is sitting in the brine, add your Korean pepper flakes, garlic, ginger, and sugar to a clean food processor, along with some water to get things moving. If desired, add miso paste as well (for umami taste). Blitz until smooth.</li>
        <li><em><strong>Mix</strong></em><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combine the well-rinsed cabbage (either whole leaves or roughly chopped), pepper paste, carrot (or daikon radish), and green onions in a large bowl, mixing well with clean hands (you may choose to use gloves here to prevent your hands from smelling).</li>
        <li><em><strong>Ferment</strong></em><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pack the mixture into clean glass jar(s), pressing down so that the veggies are submerged in the juices. Leave at least an inch of empty space at the top of the jar, then seal shut with a lid. Set the sealed jar on a plate or bowl (to catch possible leaks), and place somewhere room temperature and out of direct sunlight, letting it ferment for 2 to 5 days. Check on it everyday, pushing the cabbage down to release gasses and prevent leaks. The kimchi is finished when the taste is slightly sour and cabbage is a bit soft. The “finish point” depends on your taste. The longer you let the kimchi ferment, the more sour and less crunchy it will become. This will also go faster in a warmer environment. Simply taste it each day when you check on it, and transfer it to the fridge when it’s the perfect amount of ripe! Refrigeration will pause the fermentation process, where it will stay fresh for several weeks or months.</li>
